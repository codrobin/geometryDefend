This is a project i made in XNA for the Giant Etch-A-Sketch my School made.

All code in this project was made in three days.

If you really want to install/play this game you can download the project, go into the bin folder and run the exe.

At this time i have not made a publish version yet. 

Need .net framework to run this.
